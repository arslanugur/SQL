4. Aggregation Pipelines: Let the Server Do It For You
"""You've used projection, sorting, indexing, and limits to speed up data fetching. 
   But there are still annoying performance bottlenecks in your analysis pipelines. 
   You still need to fetch a ton of data. Thus, network bandwidth and downstream processing and memory capacity still impact performance. 
   This chapter is about using MongoDB to perform aggregations for you on the server."""
