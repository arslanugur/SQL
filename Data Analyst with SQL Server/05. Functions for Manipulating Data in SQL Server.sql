Course Description
	In this course, you will learn how to make use of the most important functions for manipulating data provided by SQL Server. 
	You can use these functions for processing and transforming data to get the results you want.

1. Choosing the appropriate data type
	In this chapter, you will learn what are the most used data types in SQL Server. 
	You will understand the differences between implicit and explicit conversion and how each type of conversion manifests. 
	You will also get familiar with the functions used for explicitly converting data: CAST() and CONVERT().

1.1. Welcome to this course!
1.2. Working with different types of data
1.3. Storing dates in a database
1.4. Types of character strings
1.5. Implicit conversion
1.6. Implicit conversion between data types
1.7. Data type precedence
1.8. Explicit conversion
1.9. CASTing data
1.10. CONVERTing data
1.11. Working with the correct data types


2. Manipulating time
	Date and time functions are an important topic for databases. 
	In this chapter, you will get familiar with the most common functions for date and time manipulation. 
	You will learn how to retrieve the current date, only parts from a date, 
	to assemble a date from pieces and to check if an expression is a valid date or not.

2.1. Functions that return system date and time
2.2. Get the know the system date and time functions
2.3. Selecting parts of the system's date and time
2.4. Functions returning date and time parts
2.5. Extracting parts from a date
2.6. Generating descriptive date parts
2.7. Presenting parts of a date
2.8. Creating a date from parts
2.9. Performing arithmetic operations on dates
2.10. Arithmetic operations with dates
2.11. Modifying the value of a date
2.12. Calculating the difference between dates
2.13. Validating if an expression is a date
2.14. Changing the date format
2.15. Changing the default language
2.16. Correctly applying different date functions


3. Working With Strings
	Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in databases. 
	It's important to know what you can do with them. 
	In this chapter, you will learn how to manipulate strings, to get the results you want.

3.1. Functions for positions
3.2. Calculating the length of a string

3.13. Splitting a string into pieces
3.14. Applying various string functions on data


4. Recognizing Numeric Data Properties
	In this chapter, you will work with functions applied to numeric data. 
	You will use aggregate functions for calculating the minimum, maximum or the sum of values from a set. 
	You will learn how to raise a number to a power or to calculate its square root.

4.1. Aggregate arithmetic functions
4.2. Learning how to count and add
4.3. MINimizing and MAXimizing some results
4.4. Analytic functions
4.5. Accessing values from the next row
4.6. Accessing values from the previous row
4.7. Getting the first and last value
4.8. Mathematical functions
4.9. Extracting the sign and the absolute value
4.10. Rounding numbers
