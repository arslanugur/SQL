# Career Track: Data Analyst with SQL Server on DataCamp

 - Introduction to SQL Server
   
   
   SQL is an essential skill for data scientists, and Microsoft SQL Server is one of the world's most popular database systems. In this course, you'll start with simple SELECT statements, and refine these queries with ORDER BY and WHERE clauses. You'll learn how to group and aggregate your results, and also how to work with strings. You'll also cover the most common way to join tables, how to create tables, and inserting and updating data. You'll mainly work with the Chinook digital media database, representing sales of various artists and tracks. The music theme continues with the classic rock and Eurovision datasets, while we also look at trends in power outages in the US. Overall, you'll become proficient in the most common data manipulation tasks in SQL Server and build a solid foundation for the upcoming T-SQL courses here on DataCamp!
   
 - Introduction to Relational Databases in SQL
   
   
   You’ve already used SQL to query data from databases. But did you know that there's a lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data, as well as the relationships between them. This gives your data structure and consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life dataset that was used to investigate questionable university affiliations. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. You'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships, as well as how to enforce data integrity. You'll also discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints.
   
 - Intermediate SQL Server
   
   
   A majority of data is stored in databases and knowing the necessary tools needed to analyze and clean data directly in databases is indispensable. This course focuses on T-SQL, the version of SQL used in Microsoft SQL Server, needed for data analysis. You will learn several concepts in this course such as dealing with missing data, working with dates, and calculating summary statistics using advanced queries. After completing this course, you will have the skills needed to analyze data and provide insights quickly and easily.
   
 - Time Series Analysis in SQL Server
   SQL Server has a robust set of tools to prepare, aggregate, and query time series data. This course will show you how to build and work with dates, parse dates from strings (and deal with invalid strings), and format dates for reporting. From there, you will see how SQL Server's built-in aggregation operators and window functions can solve important business problems like calculating running totals, finding moving averages, and displaying month-over-month differences using realistic sample data sets. You will also see how taking a different perspective on your data can solve difficult problems.
   
 - Functions for Manipulating Data in SQL Server
   
   
   In this course, you will learn how to make use of the most important functions for manipulating data provided by SQL Server. You can use these functions for processing and transforming data to get the results you want.
   
 - Database Design
   A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand. Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later on, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations have to be accounted for. In this course, you'll learn how to process, store, and organize data in an efficient way. You'll see how to structure data through normalization and present your data with views. Finally, you'll learn how to manage your database and all of this will be done on a variety of datasets from book sales, car rentals, to music reviews.

 - Hierarchical and Recursive Queries in SQL Server
   
   
   Do you want to query complex data structures in an iterative way? Do you have access to hierarchical data structures that need to be queried? This course will teach you the tools required to solve these questions. You will learn how to write recursive queries and query hierarchical data structures. To do this, you will use Common Table Expressions (CTE) and the recursion principle on a wide variety of datasets. You will, for example, dig into a flight plan dataset and learn how to find the best and cheapest connection between two airports. After completing this course, you will understand the principle of recursion, and be able to identify and create hierarchical data models.
   
 - Transactions and Error Handling in SQL Server
   
   
   It is critical to know how to handle errors and manage transactions when programming SQL scripts. Unhandled errors can be very harmful and can cause unexpected situations, such as inconsistent data in your database, or even worse, errors can lead you to make wrong business decisions. In this course, you will learn how to handle errors and discover how to manage transactions in case of an error. Additionally, you will study what happens when two or more people interact at the same time with the same data. You will practice all these concepts using two datasets, one of them based on bank accounts and the other one on an electric bike store.
   
 - Writing Functions and Stored Procedures in SQL Server
   
   
   Take your SQL Server programming to the next level. First, we demystify how to manipulate datetime data by performing temporal exploratory data analysis with the Washington DC BikeShare transactional dataset. Then, you’ll master how to create, update, and execute user-defined functions and stored procedures. You will learn the proper context for each modular programming tool and best practices. In the final chapter, you will apply all of your new skills to solve a real-world business case identifying the New York City yellow taxi utilization for each borough, and which pickup locations should be scheduled for each driver shift.
   
 - Building and Optimizing Triggers in SQL Server
   
   
   Auditing your SQL Server database and keeping data integrity can be a challenging task for DBAs and database developers. SQL Server triggers are special types of stored procedures designed to help you achieve consistency and integrity of your database. This course will teach you how to work with triggers and use them in real-life examples. Specifically, you will learn about the use cases and limitations of triggers and get practice designing and implementing them. You will also learn to optimize triggers to fit your specific needs.
   
 - Improving Query Performance in SQL Server
   
   
   A mission critical assignment is depending on your SQL coding skills. You’ve been given some code to fix. It is giving the results you need but it’s running too slow, and it’s poorly formatted making it hard to read. The deadline is tomorrow. You’ll need to reformat the code and try different methods to improve performance. The pressure is on!!! In this course we’ll be using SQL on real world datasets, from sports and geoscience, to look at good coding practices and different ways how we can can improve the performance of queries to achieve the same outcome.
