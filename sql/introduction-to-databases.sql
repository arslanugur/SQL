A Database
      A database is a collection of data that 
            is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access, as well as efficient management and updating.
      A database is made up of tables that store relevant information.
      For example, you would use a database, if you were to create a website like YouTube, 
            which contains a lot of information like videos, usernames, passwords, comments.contentImage
      In this course we will learn how to create and query databases using SQL!

Database Tables
      A table stores and displays data in a structured format consisting of columns and rows that are similar to those seen in Excel spreadsheets.
      
      Databases often contain multiple tables, each designed for a specific purpose. 
      For example, imagine creating a database table of names and telephone numbers.

      First, we would set up columns with the titles FirstName, LastName and TelephoneNumber.

      Each table includes its own set of fields, based on the data it will store.
      
      A table has a specified number of columns but can have any number of rows.
      
      
Primary Keys
      A primary key is a field in the table that uniquely identifies the table records.

      The primary key's main features:
      - It must contain a unique value for each row.
      - It cannot contain NULL values.

      For example, our table contains a record for each name in a phone book. 
      The unique ID number would be a good choice for a primary key in the table, 
      as there is always the chance for more than one person to have the same name.
                 
      - Tables are limited to ONE primary key each.
      - The primary key's value must be different for each row.


      The unique column used to identify the records is called:
          primary key



What is SQL?
      Once you understand what a database is, understanding SQL is easy. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

      SQL is used to access and manipulate a database.
      MySQL is a program that understands SQL.

      SQL can:
      - insert, update, or delete records in a database.
      - create new databases, table, stored procedures, views.
      - retrieve data from a database, etc.
      
 
SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, but there are different versions of the SQL language.
Most SQL database programs have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard, but all of them support the major commands.
